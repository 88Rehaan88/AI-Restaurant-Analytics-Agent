# AI-Restaurant-Analytics-Agent
This solution is an AI-powered analytics agent that empowers restaurant managers to query sales data using natural language. It acts as a bridge between raw data and operational strategy, transforming complex spreadsheets into clear, actionable insights.
It transforms raw sales data into actionable business insights, inventory forecasts, and automated visual reports using LangChain and Gemini 2.0.

The system combines several advanced components:
-  LangChain Agent Framework for dynamic Python code generation and execution.
-  Gemini 2.0 Flash for high-speed, reasoning-heavy data interpretation.
-  Custom Tool Integration for specialized tasks like inventory forecasting and automated visualization dashboard.
-  Rule-Based System Prompting to enforce business logic, time-series accuracy, and professional formatting.


## The Problem:
In a fast-paced restaurant environment, managers often spend hours manually reviewing sales records, performing complex calculations for inventory, and estimating future product requirements for the coming weeks. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error. Miscalculating demand or missing a subtle revenue trend can lead to costly overstocking or even potential loss.

## The Solution:
This agent acts as a 24/7 digital analyst that does the heavy lifting for you. Instead of navigating spreadsheets, you can simply ask questions in plain English. The agent performs all necessary calculations and provides deep, data-driven insights to assist you in making confident, data-backed decisions.

## Key Capabilities: 
To provide specialized restaurant intelligence, we integrated custom Python tools:

- Inventory Forecaster: Predicts next week’s product demand and calculates specific ingredient requirements based on recent sales trends.

- Sales Visualizer: Generates comprehensive monthly reports featuring automated charts for revenue trends, product performance, and weekday distributions.

## Reliability & Precision: 
Driven by a strict system prompt, the agent is grounded in business logic. It automatically interprets the latest date as "today," enforces professional formatting, and ensures every response is data-backed and formatted for immediate executive decision-making.
